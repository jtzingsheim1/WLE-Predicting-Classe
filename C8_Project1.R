# The purpose of this script is to complete the basic requirements behind the
# project 1 peer-graded assignment which is part of the Practical Machine
# Learning course from Johns Hopkins University within the Data Science
# Specialization on Coursera.
#
# The instructions say to build a model that predicts the "classe" variable
# using any of the other variables in the dataset.
#
# The input for this document is the WLE dataset which comes from the URL below.
# The script leaves behind the data object and the model object that best
# predicted the outcome, but the primary purpose is performing the analysis
# which can later be summarized in a markdown file and report.
