# WLE Predicting Classe Project README


## Overview

This repo contains my work from the course project from the
[Practical Machine Learning][1] class from Johns Hopkins University within the
[Data Science Specialization][2] on Coursera. The original instructions for the
project can be found beneath the brief description section below. The script and
markdown files were created in RStudio.

## Brief Description

The original instructions for this assignment are shown below. There are three
main files in this repo: a script, an Rmd file, and the html report. The project
began with the script, where the core analysis was performed. Once complete the
script was re-written as an Rmd file, but it was also shortened to fall within
the length limitation for the report. The R markdown file was knit into an html
report which was the deliverable for the assignment.

>## Peer-graded Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup
>
>One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular
activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project,
your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and
dumbell of 6 participants.
>
>The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the
exercise. This is the `classe` variable in the training set. You may use any of
the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how
you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected
out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use
your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
>
>Your submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of a link to a
Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your
analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the
number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if
you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online
(and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).
>
>Apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the
test data above and submit your predictions in appropriate format to the Course
Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.
